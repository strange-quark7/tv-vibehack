# Examples

One folder per TV model, each with a `debloat.txt` listing the packages that are safe to disable
on that firmware, grouped and commented. These are starting points: comment out anything you use.

| Folder | TV | OS | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xiaomi-mi-tv-4a/` | Xiaomi Mi TV 4A (MiTV-MOOQ1) | Android TV 10 | PatchWall, Mi analytics, SmartShare, MiLink |
| `visioworld-sw-22ae-nf/` | VisioWorld SW-22AE NF (Skyworth SW6H) | Google TV, Android 11 | DailyPlay/DailyHub, Skyworth after-sale, demo players; own README and restore script |

To add your TV, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). The quickest way to get a list is to
run the prompt in [PROMPT.md](../PROMPT.md) and copy the packages your assistant disabled.
